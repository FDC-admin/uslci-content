Data for the production of PVC were provided by three leading producers (3 plants) in North America.  At the time this data was collected, there were 12 companies and 25 plants producing PVC. The companies that provided data were the 3 largest producers of PVC at the time. Due to this, we are estimating that these companies produced greater than 50% of the PVC market share.
