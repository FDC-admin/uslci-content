It does so using transportation modal allocation from the USDA Ethanol Backgrounder (2007), assuming these current corn grain allocations are applicable to switchgrass and to year 2022. Distances for each mode are from a combination of references; still missing a good distance estimate for barge, but since the share of barge transportation is ~2%, the final result will not be sensititive to this parameter. Infrastructure impacts are included in this process by calling the Ecoinvent \"transport\" processes. ALSO NEED TO CREATE PARAMETERS SPECIFIC TO SWITCHGRASS INSTEAD OF USING STOVER ONES (where differences to stover can be documented).","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2013-10-22T14:12:33-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"e6e76431-5ce7-4d38-88b2-8fa51c3f669b","name":"Ethyl alcohol manufacturing"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2008","technologyDescription":"future","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2008-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"2100-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T14:12:33-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
