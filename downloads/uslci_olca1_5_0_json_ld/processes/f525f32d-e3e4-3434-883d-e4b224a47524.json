Processing steps include shredding and crushing, drying and sweating, delacquering (the removal of paints and other coatings), and air knife processing (the removal of small pieces of non-aluminum materials by using bursts of air). The objectives of melting are to adjust the alloy composition, improve metal quality, and produce the metal in a form suitable for subsequent processing. Secondary aluminum furnaces are fueled by natural gas and operate at temperatures between 700 and 800 degrees Celsius. Reverberatory furnaces, which reflect heat off the furnace walls and roof, are the most common type of furnace for melting aluminum scrap and have capacities of up to 100,000 kilograms. When molten aluminum exits the furnace, it is cast into ingot; there are different sizes and shapes of ingot molds, depending on the intended use of the metal. Dross and salt cake are two byproducts of secondary aluminum furnaces. Dross is formed when molten aluminum reacts with atmospheric oxygen and moisture. The metal composition of dross varies widely, ranging from 10 to 80 percent. The metal extracted from dross is commonly used to produce remelt secondary ingot (RSI), which is a major source of feedstock for both primary and secondary aluminum producers. Salt cake is composed of the spent flux oxides and other oxides and impurities from the melt process. Air emissions from secondary aluminum production are regulated by MACT\n(maximum achievable control technology) standards. Such emissions result from furnaces, scrap shredders, dryers, rotary dross coolers, delaquering kilns, and in-line fluxing chambers. Baghouses are the most common emission control devices used in secondary aluminum production. Solid waste management standards are governed by RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act). Baghouse dust is the predominant solid waste from secondary aluminum production.\n\nImportant note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has \nundergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet \nundergone a formal validation process.\nPlease email comments to
