To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nBased on manufacturer specifications for a Gundlach Braker model 12048 (115,212 kg; 254,000 lb.), used in crushing coal, this unit process quantifies the amount of steel needed to produce the coal crusher.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process encompasses the materials and weights of those materials necessary to construct a single 254,000 lb coal crusher, to be used for the preparation of surface-mined Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal. The unit process is based on the reference flow of 1 piece of coal crusher, 254,000 lbs, as described below, and as shown in the associated documentation (referenced below). The crusher is assumed to be constructed entirely of cold rolled steel; therefore cold rolled steel is assumed to be the only material required for crusher construction. Other materials are assumed to be negligible.  This unit process is used during LC Stage #1 to assist in the preparation of subbituminous coal. It is combined with other mine equipment construction unit processes in the assembly unit process for sub-bituminous coal,Coal mine equipment assembly; Production mix; Surface coal mine, Powder river basin, U.S. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3).\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nConstruction of the coal crusher is based on manufacturer specifications for a Gundlach Braker model 12048 coal crusher. The crusher is used to crush the extracted coal into smaller pieces which is then stored, and later transported.  The associated documentation (referenced below) provides an overview of the boundary of this unit process. Emissions related to the physical assembly of the crusher (e.g., that are emitted while putting together the components of a crusher, including transport of those components) are not considered in this study. Upstream emissions from the production of raw materials used for the construction of the crusher (e.g., cold rolled steel) are calculated outside the boundary of this unit process, based on proprietary profiles available within the GaBi model. As shown in the associated documentation and discussed above, the crusher constructed in this unit process is incorporated into the surface mine assembly processes for LC Stage #1 for surface mined Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal.  The total weight of a crusher was readily available but reliable data for the material breakdown of crusher subcomponents were not. Therefore, the crusher was assumed to be composed entirely of cold rolled steel (Steel cold rolled (St) [Metals]).  Total weight for one crusher is estimated to be approximately 115,213 kg (254,000 lbs) (Gundlach 2009).  Based on the assumption that the crusher is constructed entirely out of cold rolled steel, the total weight is assigned to this material.  Additional detail regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, is contained in the associated documentation sheets which are referenced below.\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Cold rolled sheet, steel, at plant\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
