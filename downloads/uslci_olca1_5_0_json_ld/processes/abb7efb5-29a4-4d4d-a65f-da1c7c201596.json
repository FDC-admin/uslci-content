To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis parameterized unit process calculates fuel consumption and resulting emissions to commission and decommission a surface mine for Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal in Wyoming. Decommissioning values represented as a percentage of the commissioning values. Inputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the fuel combustion and emissions created during the construction (commissioning) and the end of life (decommissioning) of a Powder River Basin subbituminous surface coal mine located in Wyoming, for the extraction of raw materials in Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1. The unit process is based on the reference flow of 1 kg of cleaned, crushed (to approximately 3 inches) Powder River Basin coal, as described below and in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). This commissioning and decommissioning unit process includes the consumption of diesel fuel by construction/demolition machinery used to perform mine commissioning and decommissioning activities (including all on-site facilities), as well as combustion emissions associated with diesel fuel consumption. Construction of machinery used at the mine during mine operations, as well as input flows and emissions associated with mine operations, are addressed in separate unit processes.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThe boundary for this unit process includes initial clearing and construction activities that take land in its natural state and to turn it into a Powder River Basin surface coal mine. These activities include clearing natural vegetation, excavation of soil and rock, grading, and construction of needed facilities. The boundary also includes decommissioning of the mine. That is, after all of the readily available coal has been extracted from the mine, decommissioning will result in the removal of infrastructure, re-contouring of land at the former mine site to the extent warranted, and planting of vegetation to help return the land to its natural state (TEEIC 2010).\r\n\r\nThe data for the commissioning of the Powder River Basin surface subbituminous coal mine came from a compilation of various sources. Many of the emission factors were taken from the Red Cliff Mine located in Colorado, which is a proposed underground bituminous coal mine. Additional references provide estimates on the distance of road needed to be built through the surface mine and the associated emission with its construction. More soil removal and grading is expected than for an underground mine, causing additional particulate matter emissions.\r\n\r\nA graphical overview of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Upstream emissions associated with the production and delivery of diesel fuel are accounted for outside of the boundary of this unit process, via proprietary profiles contained within the GaBi model. However, no machinery production is considered, since it is assumed that machinery would be used for numerous construction or demolition jobs before being replaced.\r\n\r\nSince the commissioning and decommissioning process focuses on fuel inputs and their associated combustion, it is important to understand the data sources along with their underlying assumptions and relevance to the study. Fuel consumption was based on the estimated acreage of the mine and the associated length of road which must be built. The combustion emissions were based on the Red Cliff Mine Environmental Impact Statement, completed by the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the proposed coal mine in western Colorado (BLM 2009a). The data were provided in tons of emission per year of commissioning. For this information to be useful in the context of this project, the data were converted to kilogram of emission per kilogram of coal that is anticipated to be produced over the lifetime of the coal mine, using the information shown in Table 1 of the DS (see Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Although Red Cliff Mine is producing less than the proposed surface mine, it was assumed that the commissioning emissions would be similar on a per kilogram of coal output value.\r\n\r\nRed Cliff Mine documentation did not include mercury or ammonia emissions from fuel combustion. Mercury emissions data were therefore obtained from a separate source (Conway et al. 2005) and calculated based on the fuel demand. Ammonia emission factors were obtained from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication and used to calculate the commissioning emissions (Roe et al. 2004). Reliable data for water use during coal mine commissioning and decommissioning were unable to be located and were, therefore, taken as a minor data limitation.\r\n\r\nData were not readily available to model the decommissioning portion of the mine life cycle. Therefore, it was assumed that decommissioning would result in 10 percent of the total fuel use and emissions that would result from commissioning. An adjustable parameter was also included in the unit process, to enable the user to update this assumption. Should the commissioning and decommissioning of the mine prove to be significant, further analysis on this data point is suggested, which may result in an increase or decrease in the value of this adjustable parameter, in comparison to the default value of 10 percent.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (see Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Diesel, at refinery\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2010.
