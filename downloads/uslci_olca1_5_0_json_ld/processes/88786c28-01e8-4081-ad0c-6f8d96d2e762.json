To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized unit process is based on specifications for a Powder River Coal Corp, 12,000-ton coal silo, used for railcar loading of Poweder River Basin (PRB) sub-bituminous coal at the mine site. Assumes silo constructed of steel and concrete, with negligible amounts of other materials.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the materials required for the construction of a single, 12,000–ton, steel-and-concrete, coal-loading silo, used to load PRB subbituminous coal into railcars. The unit process is based on the reference flow of 1 piece of coal-loading silo under Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1, as described in the associated documentation (referenced below). The coal-loading silo is assumed to be constructed of steel plate and concrete; other materials are assumed to be negligible. This coal-loading silo construction unit process, along with other construction unit processes for PRB sub-bituminous coal preparation equipment, is combined in a separate assembly process for PRB sub-bituminous coal processing, Coal mine equipment assembly; Production mix; Surface coal mine, Powder river basin, U.S. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of PRB sub-bituminous coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3). Surface coal mine operations are modeled in DS_Stage1_O_CoalMine_PRB_2010.01.xls, which quantifies the extraction and preparation of 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nConstruction of the coal-loading silo is based on available data for the construction of a PRB coal-loading silo. Heights for PRB coal loading silos range between 220 and 240 feet tall, while the width appears to be a third of the height (PRC 2009). It is assumed that the thickness of the walls and ceiling is two feet, while the base of the structure is eight feet thick. The coal-loading silo is used to load coal into individual rail cars at the PRB sub-bituminous coal mine site.\r\n\r\nEmissions related to the physical assembly of the loading silo (e.g., emitted when putting together the components of the silo, including transport of the components) are not considered in this study. Upstream emission from the production of raw materials used in the construction of the loading silo (e.g., steel plate) are calculated outside the boundary of this process, based on proprietary profiles available within the GaBi model. The loading silo constructed in this unit process is incorporated into the construction assembly process for LC Stage #1. \r\n\r\nThe weight of the silo was not readily available. Based on the dimensions of the loading silo discussed above, weights were calculated. The silo is assumed to be 15% steel plate, with the remaining 85 percent assumed to be concrete. The shape of the silo is a cylinder with a hole at the bottom for the trains to pull under, to facilitate loading into the railcars. Additional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation as referenced below.\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Portland cement, at plant: This flow is a proxy for Ready Mixed Concrete.  This process calculates the required mass of Portland Cement as a fraction of the required mass of Ready Mixed Concrete to construct one coal loading silo.  The default parameter setting assumes that Portland Cement comprises 14.1% (by mass) of Ready Mixed Concrete (NIST 2009); however, this parameter may be modified by the user.  This process does not consider other material and energy inputs for producing Ready Mixed Concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
