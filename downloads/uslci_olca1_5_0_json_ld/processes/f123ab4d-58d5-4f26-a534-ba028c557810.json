To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n5) Alternative parameter values can be found in the DS and/or DF\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized dataset gives coal mine methane emissions associated with surface coal mine operations in the Powder River Basin.  Alternative parameter values can be found in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).  Inputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 Item(s) of \"Methane emission; Production mix, underground mine\".\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThis parameterized unit process provides a summary of relevant output flows associated with coal mine methane emissions from surface mining. An option is provided to capture a percentage of the total methane produced, but there are no burdens associated with capturing the methane. All vented methane is assumed to be in too low a concentration to be directly flared. The reference flow of this unit process is: 1 Item(s) of \"Methane emission; Production mix, underground mine\".\r\n\r\nThis process is a modified version of the \"Coal Mine Methane Emissions\" unit process in the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Unit Process Database. Parameters and environmental emissions related to the oxidation of captured coal mine methane have been added. The reason that this process has no inputs is that it is treated as a service to the process, \"Coal extraction; Surface mine\".\r\n\r\nThis process differs slightly from the Detailed Spreadsheet Documentation (DS) file referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below.  Differences between this process and the DS are as follows:\r\n1) Different reference flows.  This is because, in the openLCA model, coal is produced in a separate process.\r\n2) Additional parameters and elementary flows that account for oxidation of captured methane to CO2.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process provides the methane emissions and captured methane streams associated with coal mining operations. This unit process is used in combination with other unit processes (UPs) to provide a complete emissions profile for coal extraction. The captured methane flow can be connected to a venting and flaring UP, a compressor for injection to a natural gas pipeline, a boiler, or similar UPs.\r\n\r\nThe coal mine methane available for either emission or capture for underground coal mining was determined by adding annual vented air methane (VAM) emissions and captured/drained methane for a collection of U.S. mines (EPA, 2010). A weighted average of the available methane per kg of coal provides the expected available methane (EIA, 2009). The expected available methane for surface mine is from a single source and is included as the minimum value (EPA, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe expected percentage of captured methane was determined from the expected national VAM emissions and the total methane available. The expected capture percentage provides an emission result consistent with underground mines across the U.S. The UP can easily be configured to reflect conditions at a particular well with higher capture rates.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis dataset should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
