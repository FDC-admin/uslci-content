It does so using transportation modal allocation from the USDA Ethanol Backgrounder (2007), assuming those current allocations are applicable to stover and for year 2022. Distances for each mode are from a combination of references; still missing a good distance estimate for barge, but since the share of barge transportation is ~2%, the final result will not be sensititive to this parameter. Infrastructure impacts are included in this process by calling the Ecoinvent \"transport\" processes. \nThe production of corn stover feedstock utilized in this transport process assigns inputs to corn stover based on activities and inputs that are required for the growth and harvest and preprocessing of corn stover and none of the activities or inputs that would normally be used to produce, harvest and preprocess corn grain (so-called \"incremental allocation\").","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2013-10-22T11:00:53-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"60c80c18-522c-4bee-bbcc-60ed18b26f92","name":"Corn Farming"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2007","technologyDescription":"modern","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2007-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"2022-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T11:00:53-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
