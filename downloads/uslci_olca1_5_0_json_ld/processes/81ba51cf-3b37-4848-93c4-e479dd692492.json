To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe parameterized system process calculates the number of each piece of equipment included in an underground, Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal mine. Includes life expectancy and replacement rates for longwall mining system, continuous miner, conveyor system, and shuttle car.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the elements required for the construction of a single underground coal mine used to extract Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal under LC Stage #1. Once the coal has been conveyed to the surface, it will be crushed and cleaned, then loaded into railcars for transport (LC Stage #2) to the power plant (LC Stage #3) over the 30-year study period, as described below and in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Input flows for the underground coal mine construction include longwall mining systems, continuous miners, shuttle cars, and a conveyor system. This unit process estimates the number of each type of equipment included in the underground coal mine, and calculates the fraction of each type of equipment needed as inputs to extract 1 kg of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal, based on the parameters  included in this dataset and in the associated documentation (referenced below).\r\n\r\nConstruction data, including the mass of raw materials required to construct a single longwall mining system, continuous miner, shuttle car, and conveyor system are calculated in separate unit processes. Therefore, the following unit processes are considered to be embedded in this system process:\r\n- Longwall miner system; Manufacture; At underground coal mine, U.S.\r\n- Continuous coal miner; Manufacture; At underground mine, U.S.; 563 kW\r\n- Coal conveyor system; Manufacture; At point-of-sale, for underground mine, U.S.; 1.22 m belt width\r\n- Coal shuttle car; Manufacture; At point-of-sale, U.S.\r\n\r\nFor a discussion of environmental emissions associated with the manufacture of raw materials used in the construction of these components, as well as other pertinent information, please refer to these separate unit processes.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Specifications for the number of longwall mining systems and continuous miners at the underground coal mine were taken from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources’ 2006 Annual Statistical Report (Illinois Department of Natural Resources 2006). These values are from the Galatia mine in southern Illinois, a representative underground mine extracting Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal. This source indicated a total of three longwall mining units and nine continuous miners in use at this mine, and these values were used for this unit process. In an e-mail communication, the expected lifetime of longwall system components was given as 10–15 years (Bruniany 2008). The average of these values (12.5 years) was assumed for the life expectancy of both the longwall mining system and the continuous miner. The lifetime of the plant (30 years) was divided by the life expectancy of the longwall system and continuous miner for a replacement rate of 2.4 for both the longwall system and continuous miner over the lifetime of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt was assumed that the conveyor system construction unit process was modeled so that a single conveyor system would be adequate to carry as much coal to the surface as required. The conveyor belt has an expected lifetime of 20 years (Goodyear 2008b), and it was assumed that the same lifetime would apply to the conveyor system as a whole. Dividing the plant lifetime by the conveyor lifetime resulted in a replacement rate of 1.5 conveyor systems over the study period.\r\n\r\nTo determine the number of shuttle cars required in the underground coal mine, it was assumed that there was a 2-to-1 ratio between the continuous miners and the shuttle cars, so that there would be 18 shuttle cars. Each shuttle car has an expected lifetime of 12 years (Australian Tax Office 2008). This lifetime results in a replacement rate of 2.5 shuttle cars over the 30-year lifetime of the plant.\r\n\r\nTo determine the portion of each piece of equipment constructed per kg of coal, a coal feedrate value was taken from a previous NETL study (NETL 2009). The coal feedrate is included as an adjustable parameter that indicates the total amount of coal required by the plant in LC Stage #3, in metric tonnes per day. The default value for this parameter is 21,719 tonnes/day, taken from the table shown in Figure 2 under Case #1 (NETL 2009). This variable can be adjusted as needed to reflect assumptions regarding the amount of coal required.\r\n\r\nTo determine the fraction of a single piece of each type of equipment required over the lifetime of the plant to produce 1 kg of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal, the coal feedrate (tonnes/day) was converted to kg/year, then multiplied by the plant lifetime (30 years) to get the kilograms of coal produced over the entire study period. Finally, the number of each type of equipment was multiplied by the replacement rate of that equipment, and then divided by the total amount of coal required over the study period.\r\n\r\nThe associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below) contains additional information on: relevant properties of a single underground coal mine; modeled input and output flows; calculation methods; and other relevant information.\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
