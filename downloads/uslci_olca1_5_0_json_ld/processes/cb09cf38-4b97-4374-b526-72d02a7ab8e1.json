To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized unit process encompasses the total amount of materials used in the construction of a crushing facility and the coal crusher.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process encompasses the materials and weights of those materials necessary to construct a single coal crusher facility, to be used for the preparation of underground Illinois No. 6 coal. The unit process is based on the reference flow of 1 coal crusher facility, as described below, and as shown in the associated documentation (referenced below). The crusher facility is assumed to be constructed of steel plate, reinforcement bar (rebar) wire and ready mixed concrete. Other materials are assumed to be negligible.  This unit process is used during LC Stage #1 to assist in the preparation of underground coal. It is combined with other mine equipment construction unit processes in the coal preparation facility assembly unit process for underground coal, Coal mine equipment assembly; Production mix; Underground coal mine, Illinois No. 6 Coal. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3).\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThe electricity requirements for coal beneficiation of a generic eastern coal mine are reported in Chapter 2, Table 2-7 of the EIA report “Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry”(DOE and NMA 2002).  Beneficiation refers to the sizing, handling and washing of run-of-mine (ROM) coal. The energy consumption values reported for coal crushing (or grinding as it is referred to in the EIA report) is 93,200 Btu/ton of coal, and is one of the more energy intensive processes during coal mining.  When converted to metric units, coal crushing consumes 30.1 KWh/ton of coal processed.  The electricity requirements for the other phases of beneficiation are included in the coal cleaning section of this report. \r\n\r\nCoal mining accounts for approximately 30 percent of methane (CH4) emissions in the U.S., with underground mines contributing the largest share of coal mining CH4 emissions (EPA 2008b).  During coal acquisition, CH4 is released during both the underground coal extraction and the post mining coal preparation activities.  From the EPA inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from 1990-2006, 90% of CH4 emitted from underground mining is a result of coal extraction, with the remaining 10% emitted during preparation (EPA 2008b). \r\n\r\nIn a report identifying opportunities for methane recovery from U.S. coal plants, the U.S. EPA Coalbed Methane outreach program surveyed methane emissions from 50 mines in 12 states, including the Galatia mine in Illinois(EPA 2008a).  Data from the Galatia mine is used throughout this study due to its similarities to the studied mine, and therefore Galatia methane values are also used. Data are summarized in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nIn 2006, 13 coal mines had invested in degasification systems to collect CH4. Collecting CH4 reduced the overall greenhouse gas emissions from the mine, and the CH4 can then be used on- site or sold to a pipeline for energy generation (EPA 2008b).  This technique is especially cost-effective in gassy mines.  Coal mines in Illinois are generally less gassy than other regions, and to date no CH4 recovery systems have been implemented in an Illinois mine (EPA 2008a).  Therefore for this study, it is assumed that no CH4 recovery system is in place and all 360 ft3 CH4/ton coal is emitted.\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, 90 percent of emission are from coal extraction while 10 percent are from post mining activities. Due to a lack of more specific data, all post mining CH4 emissions have been allocated to the coal crushing operation.  As defined in Section X, this study considers the use of both longwall and continuous miners for coal extraction.  The EIA Annual Coal Report states that a typical longwall mining operation performs longwall 80 percent of the time and uses continuous mining for the remaining 20 percent (EIA 2007).  Therefore, the remaining 90 percent of CH4 emissions is allocated 80 percent to longwall and 20 percent to continuous operations. A table outlining the allocation of underground mining CH4 emissions is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). As a check, these values were summed to insure that the allocated emissions totaled the overall value of 360 ft3 CH4/ton coal. \r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Portland cement, at plant: This flow is a proxy for Ready Mixed Concrete.  This process calculates the required mass of Portland Cement as a fraction of the required mass of Ready Mixed Concrete to construct one coal crusher facility.  The default parameter setting assumes that Portland Cement comprises 14.1% (by mass) of Ready Mixed Concrete (NIST 2009); however, this parameter may be modified by the user.  This process does not consider other material and energy inputs for producing Ready Mixed Concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis dataset should be cited as:\r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
