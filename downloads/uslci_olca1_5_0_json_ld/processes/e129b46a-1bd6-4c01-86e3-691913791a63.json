To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized unit process is based on manufacturer\u0027s specifications, a conveyor system, 1.83 m (72 in) width, from Sandvik to transport coal from prep facility to loading silo at a Powder River Basin coal mine. Materials include cold-rolled steel, hot-dip galvanized steel, and rubber.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the materials required for the construction of a single conveyor system with steel cords needed to transport Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal from the preparation facility to the loading silo, where the coal is loaded into railcars and transported to the energy conversion facility. The process is based on the reference flow of 1 piece (pcs) of steel-cord conveyor system, as described below and shown in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). The steel-cord conveyor system is assumed to be constructed of cold-rolled steel, hot-dip galvanized steel, and rubber; quantities of other material types are assumed to be negligible.\r\n\r\nThis construction unit process for the steel-cord conveyor system is combined with other pieces of equipment used during coal preparation on site, under Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1, in an individual assembly unit process, Coal mine equipment assembly; Production mix; Surface coal mine, Powder river basin, U.S. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of Powder River Basin coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3).\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Emissions related to the physical assembly of the steel-cord conveyor system (e.g., emitted while putting together the components of the conveyor system, including transport of those components) are not considered in this study. Upstream emissions from the production of raw materials used for the construction of the steel-cord conveyor system (e.g., steels) are calculated outside the boundary of this unit process, based on proprietary profiles available in the GaBi model. As discussed above and shown in the associated documentation (referenced below), the steel-cord conveyor system constructed in this unit process is incorporated into the construction assembly for LC Stage #1.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a steel-cord conveyor system was readily available, but reliable data for the material breakdown of steel-cord conveyor system were not. The steel-cord conveyor system is designed such that it transports the sized coal from the preparation facility to the loading silo. The specifications found for the conveyor system included information for the cold-rolled steel , hot-dip galvanized steel, and rubber.\r\n\r\nRelevant properties and assumptions used to calculate the amount of steel plate contained in a single steel-cord conveyor system are given in the associated documentation (referenced below). Total weight for one steel-cord conveyor system was calculated to be approximately 1,064,007 kg (1,172 short tons).  The associated documentation also contains additional information regarding: modeled input and output flows and calculation methods.\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, resin, at plant\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.
