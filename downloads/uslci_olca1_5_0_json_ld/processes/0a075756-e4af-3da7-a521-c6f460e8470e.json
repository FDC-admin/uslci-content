Ethylene dichloride data was collected with VCM data and are included within the VCM dataset.  Unreacted EDC can be sold off as a coproduct from VCM production, but this depends on the producer. Hydrochloric acid is also an input to this process; however, it is created internally as a byproduct from the combustion of emissions produced. A mass basis was used to partition the credit for this coproduct.  This process has net water outputs. The mass imbalance is due to unavailability of the weight of water inputs to production and outputs to nature. Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates by Rebe Feraldi and Melissa Huff and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.

Data for the production of EDC/VCM were provided by three leading producers (3 plants) in North America. At the time this data was collected, there were 8 companies and 12 plants producing VCM. The companies that provided data were the 3 largest producers of VCM at the time. Due to this, we are estimating that these companies produced greater than 50% of the VCM market share.
