Fuel gas and off-gas were two of the coproducts produced that were exported to another process for fuel use. When these fuel coproducts are exported from the hydrocracker, they carry with them the allocated share of the inputs and outputs for their production. The ratio of the mass of the exported fuel over the total mass output was removed from the total inputs and outputs of the hydrocracker, and the remaining inputs and outputs are allocated over the material hydrocracker products.  No energy credit is applied for the exported fuels, since both the inputs and outputs for the exported fuels have been removed from the data set.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding. Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
