To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized unit process provides a summary of relevant input and output flows associated with the removal of overburden from a surface mine. This includes the amount of electricity and fuel required to power equipment and the direct particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from operating equipment and using explosives. Combustion emissions are not included in this unit process.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODELING NOTE\r\nIn the DS file, this unit process is one of three mining stages grouped into a single proces entitled, \"Surface Coal Mining – Overburden Removal, Extraction, and Reclamation\".  The metadata below reflects the Goal and Scope, Boundary and Description, and Citation and Associated Documentation of all three mining stages within the combined process.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThis unit process provides a summary of relevant input and output flows associated with the extraction of coal from a surface mine. This includes the amount of electricity and fuel required to power equipment and the direct particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from operating equipment and using explosives. Combustion emissions are not included in this unit process. The reference flow of this unit process is: 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nNote: This process deviates from the DS in that it uses the input \"Ammonia, steam reforming, liquid, at plant\" in place of \"Ammonium nitrate\".  The input value for ammonia reflects the amount of ammonia necessary to produce the required quantity of ammonium nitrate for this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). \tThis UP is parameterized into mining stages: Overburden removal, coal extraction, and mine reclamation. This UP is based on a reference Western mine. A strip ratio from any mine can be applied to scale the impacts of the overburden removal scenario. The reference strip ratio is 5:1 and represents a reference Western mine. This UP has a diesel scalar and electricity switch to account for mines that use all diesel equipment (e.g., Indonesia).\r\n\r\nFor energy calculations, the mining equipment was separated into electrically powered equipment and diesel powered equipment. For all calculations, the equipment was separated into mining stage: overburden removal, coal extraction, and mine reclamation.\r\n\r\nThe diesel requirements were calculated using the Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry developed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division and the National Mining Association (U.S. Department of Energy and National Mining Association, n.d.).  Chapter Two of the source focused on coal; description of coal types, overview of coal mining, energy requirements for underground and surface mines, and emissions from coal mining.  The data source provides energy data for specific mining activities such as coal handling, extraction, and grinding.  BCS, Incorporated (BCS) developed the data by integrating the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s 1997 Coal Industry data into the Western Mining Engineering, Inc.’s SHERPA Mine Cost Software to create 2002 estimates.  BCS also used Mine and Mill Equipment Cost, An Estimator’s Guide to develop the data.  Newer data for specific coal mining processes are not available.  This unit process parameterizes key variables to allow for evaluation of data uncertainty when used in a life cycle model.\r\n\r\nThe reference flow for this unit process is one kg of coal.  To calculate the amount of diesel needed, the sum of the equipment’s energy requirements, in Btu per ton, was divided by the appropriate conversion to convert tons to kg and then divided by the high heating value of diesel (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2011), in Btu per kg, to obtain the diesel requirement in kg of diesel per kg of coal.  \r\n\r\nTo calculate the amount of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) used to excavate coal, 1994 data specific to the Powder River Basin (PRB) was used (Stump, B., 1995).  The average weight percentages for the composition of ANFO were taken from an ANFO material safety data sheet (Maxam North America, 2010).  The amount of ammonium nitrate was calculated by multiplying the kg of ANFO per coal produced by the average weight percent of ammonium nitrate.  The kg of ANFO per coal produced was multiplied by the average weight percent of light fuel oil to calculate the amount of light fuel oil in kg fuel oil per kg of coal.  Particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted during coal extraction from an underground mine.  To calculate the amount of VOC emissions released during the excavation of coal, 1989-1998 data specific to the PRB (McVehil, G.E., 2001) and 2011 coal production data by the National Mining Association (National Mining Association, 2012) was used. The amount of VOCs released, in tons per year, was multiplied by the appropriate conversion and divided by the amount of coal produced, which was also multiplied by the appropriate conversions, to obtain the kg of VOC per kg of coal.  The VOC emissions were calculated for the coal types of bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite by using the calculation just described above but replacing the coal produced with the appropriate coal type production value.  It was assumed the VOC emissions released were for one year.\r\n\r\nThe PM emissions were calculated using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AP 42 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2009).  Chapter 11.9 of the source focused on Western surface coal which included emission factor equations and scaling factors.  Other factors that were incorporated into these equations, such as coal moisture content, were obtained from a 2012 U.S. Department of Energy document (U.S. Department of Energy, 2012) and a Caterpillar, Inc. equipment specification (Caterpillar).  The PM emissions were broken down into extraction processes such as blasting, truck loading, bulldozing, etc.  Emission factor equations and conversions were used to calculate the amount of PM emissions based on the reference flow of one kg of coal.  Where applicable, the moisture content of coal was used to calculate PM emissions for the coal types of bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite.  To obtain the emissions for PM10 and PM2.5, the scaling factor pertaining to each emission was multiplied by the amount of PM emissions per unit of coal for both PM10 and PM25.  It was assumed that PM data not pertaining to coal types was calculated for a surface mine only.  For the bulldozer, it was assumed that the equipment operated for 12 hours per day.  A five miles per hour grading speed and 20 year lifetime of coal mine for existing mines was assumed in the calculation of the PM emissions for grading.  To calculate the unmitigated PM emissions, the sum of the PM10 and PM2.5 emissions were both multiplied by 15 percent, because it was assumed mitigation measures would reduce emissions by 85 percent.  The ammonium nitrate, electricity, light fuel oil, PM, and VOC requirements were placed as parameters in the DS file, so the items could be adjusted to measure uncertainties.  There are other adjustable parameters such as coal type and moisture content.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.
