Heat was exported as a coproduct for some producers. The energy amount for the exported heat was reported separately as recovered energy. A large amount of hydrogen chloride is produced as a coproduct during this process. A mass basis was used to partition the credit for each product.  This process has net water outputs. The mass imbalance is due to unavailability of the weight of water inputs to production and outputs to nature. The coproduct amount for hydrogen chloride is not shown due to confidentiality issues.  Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Cradle-to-Gate Life Cycle Inventory of Nine Plastic Resins and Four Polyurethane Precursors. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Plastics Division members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
