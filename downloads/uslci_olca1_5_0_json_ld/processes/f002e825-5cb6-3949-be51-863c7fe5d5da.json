It does so using transportation modal allocation from the USDA Ethanol Backgrounder (2007), assuming the current corn grain allocations described in the report are applicable to wheat straw and to year 2022. Distances for each mode are from a combination of references; still missing a good distance estimate for barge, but since the share of barge transportation is ~2%, the final result will not be sensititive to this parameter. Infrastructure impacts are included in this process by calling the Ecoinvent \"transport\" processes. \nALSO NEED TO CREATE PARAMETERS SPECIFIC TO wheat straw INSTEAD OF USING STOVER ONES (if there is reason to believe transport distances might be different amongst feedstocks). \nThe production of wheat straw feedstock utilized in this transport process assigns inputs to wheat straw based on activities and inputs that are required for the growth and harvest and preprocessing of wheat straw and none that of the activities or inputs that would normally be used to produce, harvest and preprocess wheat kernals (so-called \"incremental allocation\").","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2015-08-06T09:37:43.878-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"4ff536e2-e3cb-4729-9b78-5f986e5cba8b","name":"Wheat Farming"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2010","technologyDescription":"future","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2010-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"2100-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2015-08-06T09:37:43.878-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
