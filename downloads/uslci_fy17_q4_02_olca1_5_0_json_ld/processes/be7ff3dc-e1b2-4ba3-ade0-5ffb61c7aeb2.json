To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis parameterized unit process calculates fuel consumption and resulting emissions to commission and decommission an Illinosis No. 6 underground, bituminous coal mine in Illinois. Decommissioning values represented as a percentage of the commissioning values.  Inputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the fuel combustion and emissions created for the construction (commissioning) and the end of life (decommissioning) of an Illinois No. 6 bituminous underground coal mine located in Saline County, IL, for the extraction of raw materials in Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1. The unit process is based on the reference flow of 1 kg of cleaned, crushed (to approximately 3 inches) Illinois No. 6 coal, as described below and in the associated documentation (referenced below). The commissioning and decommissioning unit process includes the consumption of diesel fuel and gasoline by construction/demolition machinery used to perform mine commissioning and decommissioning activities (including all on-site facilities), as well as combustion emissions associated with diesel fuel and gasoline consumption. Construction of machinery used at the mine during mine operations, as well as input flows and emissions associated with mine operations, are addressed in separate unit processes.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThe boundary for this unit process includes initial clearing and construction activities that take land in its natural state and to turn it into an Illinois No. 6 underground coal mine. These activities include clearing of natural vegetation, excavation of soil and rock, grading, and construction of needed facilities. The boundary also includes decommissioning of the mine. That is, after all of the readily available coal has been extracted from the mine, decommissioning will result in the removal of infrastructure, recontouring the land around the mine to the extent warranted, and planting of vegetation to help return the land to its natural state (TEEIC 2010).\r\n\r\nMuch of the information used to model Illinois No. 6 underground bituminous coal mine operations (contained in a separate unit process) was collected from data available for the Galatia Mine, located in Saline County, IL. However, no information was available for the commissioning or decommissioning of the Galatia Mine, or of other nearby mines. As a substitute, information from the Red Cliff Mine, located in Colorado, was used. The Red Cliff Mine is a proposed underground mine that would produce a low-sulphur coal by longwall and pillar mining techniques (BLM 2009a). Information regarding the specific type of coal to be mined at Red Cliff was not available; however, the McClane Canyon Mine is located three miles north of the proposed Red Cliff Mine and produces bituminous coal. Based on the proximity of the two mines, and because Colorado is known to have substantial bituminous coal reserves, it is assumed that bituminous coal will also be produced at the Red Cliff Mine.\r\n\r\nAn overview of the boundary for this unit process can be found in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).  Upstream emissions associated with the production and delivery of gasoline and diesel fuel are accounted for outside of the boundary of this unit process via proprietary profiles contained within the GaBi model. However, no machinery production is considered, since it is assumed that machinery would be used for numerous construction or demolition jobs before being replaced.\r\n\r\nSince the commissioning and decommissioning process focuses on fuel inputs and their associated combustion, it is important to understand the data sources along with their underlying assumptions and relevance to the study. Fuel consumption and emissions data were taken from the Red Cliff Mine Environmental Impact Statement completed by the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for the proposed coal mine in western Colorado (BLM 2009a). The data were provided in tons of emission per year of commissioning. For this information to be useful in the context of this project, the data were converted to kilogram of emission per kilogram of coal that is anticipated to be produced over the lifetime of the coal mine.  The projected production rate for the Red Cliff Mine is 8.0 million short tons per year, while the average production rate for the Galatia Mine used for this study is approximately 6.6 million short tons per year. Although the Red Cliff Mine would have a somewhat larger production rate as compared to the Galatia Mine, it was assumed that commissioning and decommissioning fuel usage and emissions would be similar for both mines.\r\n\r\nRed Cliff Mine documentation did not include mercury or ammonia emissions from fuel combustion. Mercury emissions data were therefore obtained from a separate source, (Conway et al. 2005) and calculated based on the fuel demand. Ammonia emission factors were obtained from a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) publication and used to calculate the commissioning emissions (Roe et al. 2004). Reliable data for water use during coal mine commissioning and decommissioning were unable to be located and were, therefore, taken as a minor data limitation.\r\n\r\nData were not readily available to model the decommissioning portion of the mine life cycle. Therefore, it was assumed that decommissioning would result in 10 percent of the total fuel use and emissions that would result from commissioning. An adjustable parameter was also included in the unit process, to enable the user to update this assumption. Should the commissioning and decommissioning of the mine prove to be significant, further analysis on this data point is suggested, which may result in an increase or decrease in the value of this adjustable parameter, in comparison to the default value of 10 percent.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below.\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Diesel, at refinery\r\n2) Gasoline, at refinery\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL).  2015.
