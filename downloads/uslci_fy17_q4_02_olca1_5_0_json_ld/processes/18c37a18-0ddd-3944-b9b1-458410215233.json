{"@context":"http://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema/context.jsonld","@type":"Process","@id":"18c37a18-0ddd-3944-b9b1-458410215233","name":"Thermoforming, rigid polypropylene part, at plant","description":" The amount of incoming corrugated box material is equivalent to that coming out of the process as it is purchased to be used as shipping packaging for finished thermoformed items. An average of 0.149 pounds of rigid plastic part scrap is produced for every kilogram of thermoformed parts produced; this scrap is sold for recycling. The remaining solid waste generated from the facilities surveyed in this analysis is landfilled. For every kilogram of thermoformed product, 0.210 kg of solid waste is sent to landfill. Of this solid waste, an average of 96 percent by mass is process waste such as contaminated resin scrap, hydraulic oil, and/or inks; while, five percent is packaging waste from incoming materials. The small (\u003c2%) mass imbalance is due to variability in data availability for, and weighting of, amounts of ancillary inputs and waste outputs. The packaging inputs and printing emissions in this data set represent the average reported per kilogram of output across a range of procucts produced at manufacturing facilities. When using this data to represent a specific molded product, users should adjust the amount of packaging and printing emissions as needed based on the actual materials and processes used. Complete inventory data and metadata are available in full in the final report and appendices, Life Cycle Inventory of Plastic Fabrication Processes: Injection Molding and Thermoforming. This report has been extensively reviewed within Franklin Associates and has undergone partial critical review by ACC Rigid Plastics Processing Group (RPPG) members and is available at: www.americanchemistry.com. Quantities may vary slightly between the reference to main source and and this module due to rounding.  Important note: although most of the data in the US LCI database has undergone some sort of review, the database as a whole has not yet undergone a formal validation process.
