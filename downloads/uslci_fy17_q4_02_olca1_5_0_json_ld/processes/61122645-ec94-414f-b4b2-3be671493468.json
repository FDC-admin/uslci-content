To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process is a construction process that includes material requirements for the construction of a coal cleaning facility, which is a steel building used to house coal cleaning equipment. \r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThis parameterized unit process provides a summary of relevant input and output flows associated with the construction of a steel building to be used to house coal cleaning equipment; a steel building with a reinforced concrete slab as a foundation. This process encompasses all of the materials that are required for construction. Input flows include concrete cement, rebar wire, cold-rolled stainless steel, and zinc for the use of zinc-galvanized steel panels.  The reference flow of this unit process is: 1 piece (pcs) of Coal Cleaning Facility.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThis process encompasses all of the materials that are required in the construction of a steel building to be used to house coal cleaning equipment; a steel building with a reinforced concrete slab as a foundation. The concrete slab will also serve as the first floor of the building. Carbon steel I-beams (high-strength, low alloy) will form the exterior frame of the buildings as well as each of the other five floors, plus the roof (Saginaw, 2009). The walls and roof of the facility will be constructed out of zinc-galvanized steel panels (Bay Area Rapid Transit, 2004; Buildings Direct, 2009; Steel Building, 2009; Engineers Edge, 2009). \r\n\r\nThe exterior of the building will be 100 ft. long × 60 ft. wide (NETL, 2010). Vertical I-beams will be spaced every 20 ft. along all four walls. Horizontal I-beams will form the floors from the second level up to and including the roof (six total levels). Each level will be 14 ft. tall, for a total building height of 84 ft (NETL, 2010). The I-beams for the floor will be spaced every 20 ft., running horizontally both the length and width of the building. The weight of the steel for the I-beams will be determined by taking the average of four beams with a depth of 12 in.\r\nThe exterior of the building, all four walls and the roof, will be clad in 26-gauge zinc-galvanized carbon steel panels (Buildings Direct, 2009; Engineers Edge, 2009; Steel Building, 2009). The zinc is a layer with a volume of approximately 1.25 ounces per square ft (oz/ft2) of steel panel (Bay Area Rapid Transit, 2004).\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the building, which will also serve as the ground floor, will be constructed using a 4,000 psi mix of concrete (NETL, 2010). The concrete foundation will be reinforced by size #4 carbon steel rebar running horizontally over both the length and the width of the concrete. The rebar will be evenly spaced every 12 in. in both directions, and has a cross-sectional area of 0.20 in2 (CRSI, 2008). The perimeter of the slab must be located below the frost line, which is located 21 in. below ground level at the mine location (Weather Bureau, 2008). The exterior of the concrete slab will extend an additional 6 in. below the frost line and will be 18 in. thick around the perimeter. The interior of the concrete slab will be 1 in. thick.\r\n\r\nThe flooring for each level of the building is assumed to consist of steel grating. This weight is excluded from these calculations due to the assumption they will be balanced by the sections of the interior I-beams that will be removed for stairways and to accommodate large pieces of equipment.\r\n\r\nThe weight of each material used in the coal cleaning facility was calculated separately. The materials were cold-rolled steel for the I-beams and the exterior paneling, zinc for the galvanization of the paneling, reinforcement bar (i.e. rebar) for reinforcing the concrete foundation, and concrete for the building foundation. The input and output flows for the construction of the coal cleaning facility are illustrated in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Cold rolled sheet, steel, at plant\r\n2) Portland cement, at plant: This flow is a proxy for Ready Mixed Concrete.  This process calculates the required mass of Portland Cement as a fraction of the required mass of Ready Mixed Concrete to construct one coal cleaning facility.  The default parameter setting assumes that Portland Cement comprises 14.1% (by mass) of Ready Mixed Concrete (NIST 2009); however, this parameter may be modified by the user.  This process does not consider other material and energy inputs for producing Ready Mixed Concrete.\r\n3) Zinc, sheet\r\n\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis dataset should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
