These studies included both published information and personal interviews with timber harvesting contractors.\nThe costs, production and consumption rates were developed for equipment options within each component of the system.  Harvesting systems were developed as combinations of these harvesting components.  Although there are many combinations of harvesting equipment and systems that can be used for harvesting timber, this analysis assumes the use of the most common systems operating on the range of slope classifications identified for the harvested sites.","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"1989-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"1996-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2013-04-09T09:09:22-06:00","geographyDescription":"US Inland West including Montana, Idaho, and eastern Washington","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ae081e38-d629-3c22-86de-dbc3bb038016","name":"Maureen Puetmann"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"ae081e38-d629-3c22-86de-dbc3bb038016","name":"Maureen Puetmann"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"fd6020df-eb36-3f50-99bc-fe89ae471137","name":"Leonard R.
