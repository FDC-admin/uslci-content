It assumes the trailer will be loaded at the preprcessing facility by gravity, i.e., no additional step or equipment necessary. The distance from the preprocessing facility to the conversion plant is assumed to be 1/2 the distance from the landing to the conversion facility. We assume unloading is by gravity at the conversion facility (either a trailer that has a \"live bottom\" or is tipped) requiring, if any, negligable energy/emissions which we omit consideration of. (Leinonen 2004 provides foundation for the loading and unloading assertions on pgs 44-45 and Fig 14, respetively.) Thus, the only step modeled is transport. Transport infrastructure is accounted for by utilizing Ecoinvent \"transport\" modules. The transport vehicle is a \"chip van.\" We use the closest approximation to the chip van that the Ecoinvent database has available (a lorry).\n\nThis process assumes incremental allocation of co-products in the feedstock production processes.","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2013-10-22T13:59:20-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"0b85caf4-9471-4988-9398-d2ac5b29f90b","name":"Unspecified"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2008","technologyDescription":"Unspecified","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2008-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"2008-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T13:59:20-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd4e5378-7978-3203-bfdf-acc867500cb3","name":"Daniel Inman"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"dd4e5378-7978-3203-bfdf-acc867500cb3","name":"Daniel Inman"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
