These studies included both personal interviews with timber harvesting contractors and published information.  The costs, production and consumption rates were \ndeveloped for equipment options within each component of the system.  Harvesting systems were developed as combinations of these harvesting components.  Although there are many combinations of harvesting equipment and systems that can be used for harvesting timber, this analysis assumes the use of the most common systems.","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by
