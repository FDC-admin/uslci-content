{"@context":"http://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema/context.jsonld","@type":"Process","@id":"4b4db9ff-6ce1-4b10-9353-baae83afbee1","name":"Coal extraction; Underground mine","description":"This process is part of the NETL Unit Process Library.  To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis parameterized unit process calculates the fuel and non-combustion emissions for the extraction of raw coal from an underground coal mine. Inputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThis unit process provides a summary of relevant input and output flows associated with the amount of electricity required to power equipment used in the extraction of raw coal from an underground mine. This equipment includes drills and explosives loaders. Fuel and non-combustion emissions for the operation of an underground coal mine are also included. Key inputs include electricity, light fuel oil, ammonium nitrate, diesel, coal, coal mine methane, and coal ventilation. Electricity, light fuel oil, ammonium nitrate, and diesel are also adjustable parameters to measure uncertainties. Extracted coal, Dust (PM10 and PM2.5), and VOCs are key outputs. All of these outputs except extracted coal are also adjustable parameters to measure uncertainties. The unit process is based on the reference flow of one kg of coal. The relevant flows of this unit process are described below and shown the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nNote: This process deviates from the DS in that it uses the input \"Ammonia, steam reforming, liquid, at plant\" in place of \"Ammonium nitrate\".  The input value for ammonia reflects the amount of ammonia necessary to produce the required quantity of ammonium nitrate for this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). The electricity and diesel requirements were calculated using the Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry developed by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division and the National Mining Association (DOE and NMA 2002). Chapter Two of the source focused on coal; description of coal types, overview of coal mining, energy requirements for underground and surface mines, and emissions from coal mining. The data source provides energy data for specific mining activities such as coal handling, extraction, and grinding. BCS, Incorporated (BCS) developed the data by integrating the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration’s 1997 Coal Industry data into the Western Mining Engineering, Inc.’s SHERPA Mine Cost Software to create 2002 estimates. BCS also used Mine and Mill Equipment Cost, An Estimator’s Guide to develop the data. Newer data for specific coal mining processes are not available. This unit process parameterizes key variables, which allow for evaluation of data uncertainty when used in a life cycle model.\r\n\r\nDrills, two boom jumbo, continuous mining machine, raise borers, ANFO loaders, roof bolter, water pumps, and diamond drill were the pieces of equipment used for extracting coal from an underground mine; the drills, two boom jumbo, continuous mining machine, water pumps, and diamond drill use electricity, while the raise borers, ANFO loaders, and roof bolter use diesel. The reference flow for this process is one kg of coal. To calculate the electricity needed, the sum of the energy requirements for the equipment that uses electricity, in Btu per ton, was divided by the appropriate conversions to obtain the electricity needed in kWh per kg. The diesel requirement was calculated by dividing the sum of the energy requirements, in Btu per ton, for the equipment that uses diesel by the appropriate conversion to convert tons to kg and then divided by the high heating value of diesel (EIA 2011), in Btu per kg, to obtain the diesel requirement in kg of diesel per kg of coal. To calculate the amount of ANFO used to excavate coal, 1994 data specific to the Powder River Basin (PRB) was used (Stump 1995). The average weight percentages for the composition of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil in ANFO were taken from an ANFO material safety data sheet (Maxam North America 2010). The amount of ammonium nitrate required, in kg ammonium nitrate per kg coal, was calculated by multiplying the kg of ANFO per coal produced by the average weight percent of ammonium nitrate. The kg of ANFO per coal produced was multiplied by the average weight percent of light fuel oil to calculate the amount of light fuel oil required in kg fuel oil per kg of coal. Particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted during coal extraction from an underground mine. To calculate the amount of VOC emissions released during the excavation of coal, 1989-1998 data specific to the PRB (McVehil, Addison, and Baugues 2001) and 2011 coal production data by the National Mining Association (NMA 2009) was used. In National Mining Association (2009), the total value for each coal type was used as the coal production item in the calculations. The amount of VOCs released, in tons per year, was multiplied by the appropriate conversion and divided by the amount of coal produced, which was also multiplied by the appropriate conversions, to obtain kg of VOC per kg of coal. The VOC emissions were calculated for the coal types of bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite by using the calculation just described above but replacing the coal produced with the appropriate coal type production value. It was assumed the VOC emissions released were for one year. Data for PM emissions was taken from 2008 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data (EPA n.d.). Underground mines’ coal production data was obtained from 2008 U.S. Energy Information Administration historical data (EIA n.d.). PM emissions were calculated for underground mines only, not specific coal types. The PM emission factors were separated into PM10 and PM2.5. The following description for calculating the PM10 emissions is the same for PM2.5. The amount of PM10 emissions for each county throughout the U.S. was multiplied by the coal production of its specific county to obtain the amount of PM10 emissions within the specific county. This number was then multiplied by the coal production percentage for the specific county, which was the coal production for the specific county divided by the total coal production throughout all the U.S. counties in order to obtain the emissions for the specific county. The PM10 and PM2.5 emissions are the sum of the PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for every county, respectively. A minimum and maximum value for PM10 and PM25 was obtained. The PM10 minimum and maximum values were calculated by taking the percentile of the PM10 emissions per coal production for each county for 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively. This method was also used to calculate the minimum and maximum values for PM2.5. The ammonium nitrate, electricity, light fuel oil, PM, and VOC requirements were placed as parameters so the items could be adjusted to measure uncertainties.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.
