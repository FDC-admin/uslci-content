To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis parameterized system process calculates the quantity of each piece of equipment needed to extract and produce coal at a large surface mine, mining PRB sub-bituminous coal, over the lifetime of the plant.  Inputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 kg of coal.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThis system process assembles the types and pieces of equipment required for the construction of a surface coal mine used to extract and produce Powder River Basin (PRB) sub-bituminous coal under Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1. The coal produced is transported by rail (LC Stage #2) to an energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3) over a 30 year study period, as described below and visually represented in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Draglines, shovels, loaders, a conveyor system, drills, crushers, silos, and trucks are the included input flows for the assembly of a single PRB coal surface mine. This assembly process sums the necessary equipment for construction of the surface mine by using the expected equipment lifetimes in comparison to the 30 year study period. Inputs calculated in this way are scaled to produce 1 kg of PRB sub-bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nConstruction data, including the mass of raw materials required to construct a single piece of each type of equipment, are calculated in separate unit processes. Therefore, the following unit processes are considered to be embedded in this assembly unit process: \r\n- Dragline; Manufacture; At plant; 7,439 metric tonne working weight\r\n- Electric shovel; Manufacture; At plant; 109 metric tonne payload\r\n- Track loader; Manufacture; At point-of-sale, U.S.; 178 kW\r\n- Coal conveyor system; Manufacture; At point-of-sale, for surface mine; 1.83 m belt width\r\n- Blasthole drill; Manufacture; At plant, For surface coal mine\r\n- Tractor-propelled coal crusher;  Manufacture; At plant, Powder River Basin coal\r\n- Coal loading silo;  Manufacture; For railcar loading of coal at mine\r\n- Mining truck; Manufacture; For surface mine, At plant; Gross machine operating weight  623,690 kg\r\n\r\nFor a discussion of environmental emissions associated with the manufacture of raw materials used in the construction of PRB coal surface mine components, as well as other pertinent information, please refer to these separate unit processes.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).  The total annual production of the representative PRB coal surface mine was taken from the average of the top four producing surface mines in the Powder River Basin during 2008, North Antelope-Rochelle, Black Thunder, Jacobs Ranch, and Cordero Rojo (NMA 2009). This average, 60,804,057,198.5 kg/year, was multiplied by the length of the study period (default value of 30 years) for a total of 1,824,121,715,955 kg over the life of the mine.\r\n\r\nData for the bucket capacity, PRB coal density, and PRB coal seam thickness near the representative mine site were used to determine the amount of overburden needed to be moved by a single dragline annually (Miners Midweek 2006, Bucyrus International 2008d, McCartney and Williams 2009, EPA 2004). The total amount of overburden removed by draglines was divided by the removal capacity of a single dragline for an estimate of 3 draglines required to be in operation at the mine site at one time. An individual dragline was assumed to have a life expectancy of 30 years, or one study period.\r\n\r\nThe number of electric shovels required at the mine site was calculated by using specifications for the number of shovels in use at Black Thunder Mine (Thunder Basin Coal Company 2009) and Cordero Rojo (MiningTechnology.com 2009), and the amount of coal extracted annually at those mines (NMA 2009). The average amount of coal mined per shovel, per year was 6,378,470,888 kg/shovel/year. The average amount of PRB coal mined per year at the representative mine (NMA 2009) was divided by this amount for a total of 10 shovels in operation at the mine. Once again, the life expectancy of a single shovel was assumed to be 30 years.\r\n\r\nFor the track loader, it was assumed that 10 pieces were required at the mine. Each loader was assumed to have a 30 year life expectancy. Specifications for a Goodyear conveyor belt stated that their belts could be expected to last 20 years (Goodyear Engineered Products 2009b), so that was assumed to be the lifetime of the entire conveyor system. The conveyor system itself was sized from specifications for a system in use at a PRB mine, so it was assumed that there would only be a single conveyor system constructed.\r\n\r\nThe SME Mining Engineering Handbook stated that three rotary drills were required during cast blasting of overburden, so it was assumed that the study mine would also require three pieces (SMME 1992). Each of the drills is assumed to have a 30 year lifetime. Manufacturer specifications gave a capacity of 10,000 short tons of coal per hour for a Gundlach coal crusher (Gundlach Equipment Corporation 2009). This value was converted to kg coal/year, and then the estimated annual mine production was divided by the total, which came out to be a single crusher. This single crusher was assumed to be the only one required to crush coal at the mine, and was also assumed to have a 30 year life expectancy.\r\n\r\nBNSF publications listed the number of coal loading silos in use at each of the 4 PRB mines used to determine the coal production rate of the study mine (BNSF 2009). Records for 3 of the 4 stated that some additional slot storage capacity was unaccounted for in the number of silos, and this was taken into account when calculating the number of silos at the study mine. The number of silos averaged out to 5.5, so this number was rounded up to 6 total silos to account for additional slot storage capacity. Each of the silos was assumed to last the entire length of the 30 year study period.\r\n\r\nThe final type of equipment in use at the PRB coal surface mine was mining trucks. Each truck has a hauling capacity of 345,000 kg (Caterpillar 2003). The estimated mine production per year was converted to kg/hour. It was assumed that each truck could make 2 round trips from being loaded to a coal stockpile location each hour. The mine production (in kg/hour) was divided by an individual truck’s haul capacity, and then divided by two trips/hour, for a total of 10 trucks at the mine. The trucks were assumed to have a life expectancy of 10 years.\r\n\r\nFor each type of equipment, the replacement rate was calculated by dividing the mine lifetime (default value of 30 years) by the expected lifetime of that type of equipment. This resulted in replacement rates of 1.0 pieces/study-period for the draglines, shovels, loaders, drills, crushers, and silos; 1.5 pieces for the conveyor system, and 3.0 pieces for the trucks. The final calculation was to multiply the number of each type of equipment required by the replacement rate for the same type of equipment, then divide that value by the estimated total production of the mine over the duration of the study period. These values, in pcs/kg coal produced, are for the fraction of a single piece of each type of equipment required over the life of the study to produce 1 kg of PRB sub-bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nThe annual mine production adjustable parameter is the total amount of PRB sub-bituminous coal estimated to be produced at the mine over the life of the mine. This parameter was based on the average yearly production of the top four producing PRB surface mines in 2008. This variable can be adjusted to reflect a larger or smaller scale surface mine.\r\n\r\nThe mine lifetime adjustable parameter indicates the temporal boundary of the study. In this case, the default value is 30 years, which can be adjusted to reflect a longer or shorter study period based on mine life expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe equipment lifetime adjustable parameters give the estimated or assumed life expectancy of a single piece of a given type of equipment. The default values for the draglines, shovels, loaders, drills, crusher, and silo were all assumed to be 30 years. The conveyor system was assumed to have a lifetime of 20 years, based on manufacturer specifications for the belt. The mining trucks were assumed to have a default lifetime of 10 years. Each of these values was assumed, and can be adjusted to reflect longer or shorter equipment life expectancies.\r\n\r\nThe final group of adjustable parameters was for the number of each type of equipment required to be in operation at the mine at any given point in time. The default number of track loaders and conveyor systems were assumed values. The number of other pieces of equipment was based on equipment capacity, mine size, and the mine production rate. The number of any type of equipment can be adjusted to reflect assumptions reflecting larger or smaller scale mine operations.\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, calculation methods and other relevant information are available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
