WRT soil carbon, what is not known, is the degree of carbon release from the decomposed fine roots in the soil and whether the net release of fine root carbon will be different over different time periods and under different treatment regimes. The results do not address soil carbon or the effect of forest management activities on total soil carbon because no reliable predictors were found that relate to the management treatments being considered.
