To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process is based on manufacturer specifications for a Caterpillar model 797B, 623,690 kg, mining truck, to carry coal at a Powder River Basin surface mine for subbituminous coal. It quantifies the amount of steel and rubber needed for construction.\t\t\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process encompasses the materials and weights of materials necessary to construct a single 623,690 kg mining truck, to be used for the transportation of coal at a surface mine located in the Powder River Basin region of the United States, during raw material acquisition. The process is based on the reference flow of 1 piece of mining truck, 623,690 kg empty truck weight, as described below, and as shown in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). The mining truck is assumed to be constructed of steel plate, and styrene-butadiene-rubber for the tires; therefore steel plate is assumed to be the only material required for the remainder of the truck construction. Other materials are assumed to be negligible.\r\n\r\nThis process is used during LC (Life Cycle) Stage #1 to assist in the preparation of subbituminous coal extraction process by transporting the coal within the boundaries of the surface mine. It is combined with other surface mine equipment construction unit processes in an individual assembly surface unit process for Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal, Coal mine equipment assembly; Production mix; Surface coal mine, Powder river basin, U.S. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nConstruction of the mining truck is based on manufacturer specifications for a Caterpillar model 797B, 623,690 kg mining truck. The mining truck is used to transport extracted coal to the crushing facility in preparation for transport. All use of the mining truck occurs within the confines of the mine.\r\n\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Emissions related to the physical assembly of the mining truck (e.g., that are emitted while putting together the components of a mining truck, including transport of those components) are not considered in this study. Upstream emissions from the production of raw materials used for the construction of the mining truck (e.g., steel plate) are calculated outside the boundary of this unit process, based on proprietary profiles available within the GaBi model. As discussed above and shown in the associated documentation (referenced below), the mining truck constructed in this unit process is incorporated into the Powder River Basin surface mine assembly processes for LC Stage #1 for sub-bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a mining truck was readily available but reliable data for the material breakdown of mining truck subcomponents aside from the tires were not. Therefore, the mining truck was assumed to be composed solely of carbon steel and rubber.\r\n\r\nRelevant properties and assumptions used to calculate the amount of steel plate contained in a single mining truck are discussed in the associated documentation (referenced below). Total weight for one mining truck is estimated to be approximately 623,690 kg (1,375,000 lbs) (Caterpillar 2003). Based on the assumption that the truck is constructed entirely out of carbon steel with the exception of the tires which are made out of styrene-butadiene-rubber, 31,815 kg are assigned to the tires with the remainder attributed to carbon steel. Additional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (referenced below).\r\n\r\nThis process contains one or more surrogate product flows as replacements for proprietary product flows used in the NETL Unit Process Library.  All surrogate flow were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database; a list of surrogate flows used in this process is provided below:\r\n1) Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, resin, at plant\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
