To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process considers water use and quality from underground mining of coal, based on data for Illinois No. 6 coal.  \r\nInputs and outputs are reported on the basis of 1 Item of \"Water use and quality; Production mix, from underground coal mine\".\r\n\t\t\t\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this process covers the water use and water quality for underground mining of coal. Water flows include water required for mining and cleaning operations and wastewater flows. Storm water is included in the inventory for wastewater flows. This process is based on the reference flow of 1 Item of \"Water use and quality; Production mix, from underground coal mine\".  \r\n\r\nThis process differs slightly from the Detailed Spreadsheet Documentation (DS) file referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below.  Differences between this process and the DS are as follows:\r\n1) Different reference flows.  This is because, in the openLCA model, coal is produced in a separate process.\r\n2) Different units for input flows.  Units for inputs In the openLCA model have been converted from liters (L) to kilograms (kg) based on the densities of fresh and salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process is based on water data for the underground mining of Illinois No. 6 coal. It is assumed that all underground mines have similar water use and quality profiles.\r\n\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below).  Water use was estimated by dividing USGS 2005 county-level water use (USGS 2000) by the 2005 Galatia Mine coal production (EIA 2013), which correlates well with an estimate provided by Galatia Mine staff (Personal Communication 2009). Water use for other counties with coal mines is provided to provide a bound for uncertainty. Water emissions data, including flows and concentrations of relevant inorganic constituents and biological oxygen demand, were taken from available National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit reporting documentation for Galatia Mine from 2009-2011 (EPA 2013).\r\n\r\nAdditional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section in the below).\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
