To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\r\nThis unit process is based on specifications for a 2 meter wide hydraulic shield. It assumes shield constructed entirely of steel plate with negligible amounts of other materials.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process encompasses the weight of materials necessary to construct a single 28.2 short ton, 2 meter wide hydraulic shield, to be used during the longwall underground mining of coal. The process is based on the reference flow of 1 piece of shield, as described below, and as shown in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). The shield is assumed to be constructed entirely of steel; other materials are assumed to be negligible. By default, all steel within this study was assumed to be steel plate, based on available GaBi profiles, unless other steel types were specified per available data, or a higher grade of steel would be required, per NETL engineering judgment. Therefore, all steel considered in this unit process was assumed to be steel plate.\r\n\r\nThis unit process is used during Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1 to assist in the mining of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal from an underground coal mine. It is combined with other longwall mining system equipment construction unit processes in an individual assembly unit processes for underground mining, Longwall mining system; Equipment assembly; Production mix, at underground coal mine. This assembly unit process quantifies the fraction of each piece of underground mining equipment needed under LC Stage #1 to produce 1 kg of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal ready for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3).\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nConstruction of the shield is based on specifications for 2-meter shields installed in 2004 at the Cumberland Mine, an underground coal mine located in Waynesburg, PA. The shield supports the roof of the mine at the mine face to prevent it from collapsing.\r\n\r\nA visual representation of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (referenced in the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Emissions related to the physical assembly of the shield (e.g., emitted while putting together the components of a shield, including transport of those components) are not considered in this study. Upstream emissions from the production of raw materials used for the construction of the shield (e.g., steel plate) are calculated outside the boundary of this unit process, based on proprietary profiles available within the GaBi model. As shown in the associated documentation (referenced below) and discussed above, the shield constructed in this unit process is incorporated into the longwall mining system assembly processes for LC Stage #1 for Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal mining.\r\n\r\nThe total weight of a shield was readily available, but reliable data for the material breakdown of shield subcomponents were not. Therefore, the shield was assumed to be composed entirely of steel plate. Relevant properties and assumptions used to calculate the amount of steel plate contained in a single shield are available in the associated documentation (referenced below). The specifications gave a weight of approximately 25,583 kg (56,400 lbs) for one shield (Bryja et al. 2004). Based on the assumption that the shield is constructed entirely out of steel plate, the total weight is assigned to this material. Additional details regarding input and output flows, including calculation methods, are contained in the associated documentation (referenced below).\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
