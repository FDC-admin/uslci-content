To access the library and the original dataset:\r\n1) Navigate to the NETL LCA home page (http://www.netl.doe.gov/lca)\r\n2) Then navigate to the “Unit Process Library” \r\n3) From the library, the unit process of interest can be found either through the \"Complete Listing of the Unit Process Library link\" or through the link to the \"Unit Process Database\" spreadsheet\r\n4) For each process, a Data Sheet (DS) and Data File (DF) are available\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThis parameterized dataset calculates the number of each type of equipment required to prepare Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal for transport from an underground coal mine. It includes the following facilities: silo, stacker, crusher facility, cleaning facility, and waste water treatment plant.\r\n\r\nGOAL AND SCOPE\r\nThe scope of this unit process covers the elements required for the construction of a single coal preparation facility required to prepare Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal under Life Cycle (LC) Stage #1. After preparation, the coal will be loaded into railcars for transport (LC Stage #2) to the energy conversion facility (LC Stage #3) over the 30-year study period, as described below and in the associated documentation (see the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). Input flows for this coal preparation facility assembly unit process include coal loading silos, stockpile stacker reclaimers, coal crusher facilities, coal cleaning facilities, and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This unit process estimates the number of each type of equipment included in the coal preparation facility, evaluates the life expectancy and replacement rate for each input, and calculates the fraction of each type of equipment needed as inputs to prepare 1 kg of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal, based on the parameters shown above and in the DS.\r\n\r\nConstruction data, including the mass of raw materials required to construct a single silo, stacker, crusher facility, cleaning facility, and WWTP, are calculated in separate unit processes. Therefore, the following unit processes are considered to be embedded in this assembly unit process: \r\n- Coal loading silo;  Manufacture; For railcar loading of coal; U.S.; 295 metric tonnes\r\n- Coal stockpile stacker;  Manufacture; At point-of-sale, U.S.\r\n- Coal crusher facility; Construction; At mine, U.S.\r\n- Coal cleaning facility;  Construction; At mine; U.S.\r\n- Coal mine wastewater treatment plant; Construction; Underground coal mine, U.S.\r\n\r\nFor a discussion of environmental emissions associated with the manufacture of raw materials used in the construction of unit train components, as well as other pertinent information, please refer to these separate unit processes.\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND DESCRIPTION\r\nAn overview of the boundary of this unit process is available in the associated documentation (see the Citation and Associated Documentation section below). The total number of coal loading silos at the coal preparation facility was calculated based on coal production at the coal mine where the representative silo is located. This mine, the Wolverine mine in British Columbia, Canada, has a single silo. Wolverine mine had permits to extract up to 3 million tonnes of coal per year, as of 2008 (Western Coal 2010). To determine the number of silos, the required amount of coal at the Study mine was determined by ratioing to the coal feedrate required by the energy conversion facility in LC Stage #3, in metric tonnes per day. This coal feedrate is an adjustable parameter, which can be adjusted as needed to reflect assumptions regarding the amount of coal required. The default value for this parameter is 21,719 tonnes/day. Multiplied by 365 days/year, the total amount of coal required is 7,927,435 tonnes/year. This value was divided by 3,000,000 tonnes/year (the capacity of a single silo) and rounded up for a total of 3 silos.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime of the plant was assumed to be 30 years. Each type of equipment or facility was assumed to have a life expectancy of 30 years, which means that the replacement rate for each is 1. To determine the fraction of a single piece of each type of equipment required over the lifetime of the plant, to produce 1 kg of Illinois No. 6 bituminous coal, the coal feedrate (tonnes/day) was converted to kg/year, and then multiplied by the plant lifetime (30 years) to get the total amount of coal produced over the Study period. Finally, the number of each type of equipment was multiplied by the relevant replacement rate, and then divided by the total amount coal required over the study period.\r\n\r\nThe associated documentation (referenced below) contains: relevant properties of a single Illinois No. 6 coal preparation facility used for the calculation of input and output flows for this unit process ; a summary of modeled input and output flows; additional details showing calculation methods for input and output flows; and other relevant information.\r\n\r\nCITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION\r\nThis document should be cited as: \r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2015.
