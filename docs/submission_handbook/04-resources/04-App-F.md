# Example openLCA Element Addition

In the openLCA interface, there is a navigation tree in the gray panel to the left. Here you will find all the 'Processes' and 'Flows' from the uploaded USLCI Database. However, before using an element to compile your datasets, it must either exist in the USLCI Database or have been defined in your database. If a field has a pull-down menu with options but your desired content is not available, you may add items to the associated field list using the openLCA navigation panel. For example, you may need to add yourself as an actor. Shown below is the sequence for adding this element. Once added as an actor, you will appear as a choice in the pull-down menu for selecting actors, e.g., in populating the Administrative Information fields. Other additions (e.g., processes, flows, providers, sources, etc.) follow a similar procedure. NREL requests that processes be filed in existing categories. Please contact the Data Curator if you feel none of the available categories are appropriate and NREL will work with you to add a category.
