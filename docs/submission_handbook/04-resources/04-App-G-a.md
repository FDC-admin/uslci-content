# Download/Import of EPA DATA QUALITY MATRIX

You may download the US EPA Data Quality Matrix directly from the [openLCA Downloads](https://www.openlca.org/download/) page. You may choose this procedure if you are not using the FLCAC Starter Database but you still want to use the EPA Data Quality system in an openLCA database.

## Step 1: MANUAL USE OF THE MATRIX

## Step 2: IMPORT THE MATRIX

To add the US EPA Data Quality to your openLCA **_"Indicators & Parameters,"_** you must import both files for each database in which you wish to use this pedigree matrix (as the only default matrix available is that from ecoinvent). 
* Thus, you can open the database of interest in openLCA, right-click on the database name, and select **_"Import."_** 
* You may then select **_Linked Data (JSON-LD)_** as the file type and click **_"Next."_** 
* In the **_"Choose Directory,"_** field, designate your **_"Downloads"_** folder and the **_“d13b2bc4-5e84-4cc8-a6be-9101ebb252ff….zip”_** and **_“70bf370f-9912-4ec1-baa3-fbd4eaf85a10….zip“_** files you just downloaded should appear as an option. Select each file and click **_"Finish."_** The Pedigree Matrix files are not very large so should import very quickly.
