## Rule 12: General flow and process naming rules

_(Recommended for both technical and non-technical target audience)_

- Entries within the same name component field should be listed separated by the character,&quot;&quot;. Within the entries of the various name component fields the character &quot;;&quot; should be avoided.
- Abbreviations should be avoided in the base name field, unless these are very widely in use and complement the long name in the name field (e.g. do not use &quot;PP&quot; for &quot;Polypropylene&quot;, but it can be added as &quot;Polypropylene, PP&quot;) or chemical element symbols (e.g. do not use &quot;Fe&quot; for &quot;Iron&quot;).
- Chemical symbols can be used in the &quot;Quantitative flow properties&quot; field to indicate concentrations (e.g. &quot;45% Fe&quot; for an iron ore can be used).
- Brackets within the field entries should be avoided.

Note: the entries among the four separate name component fields are separated by the character &quot;;.&quot;.

## Rule 13: &quot;Base name&quot; field

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Definition: &quot;General descriptive name of the flow. Technical language should be used.&quot;

Additional recommendations: The technical name should be given as it is used in the respective industry or toward their customers. For emissions the &quot;base name&quot; is the only one to be used; for certain resource flows also the last name component &quot;quantitative flow properties&quot; (see more below) is required, e.g. for energetic raw materials such as &quot;Hard coal; 32.7 MJ/kg net calorific value&quot;. Recommendations for land use flows will depend on further developments in the LCIA area.

## Rule 14: &quot;Treatment, standards, routes&quot; name field

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Definition: &quot;Qualitative information on the (product or waste) flow in technical term(s): treatment received, standard fulfilled, product quality use information, production route name, educt name, primary / secondary etc. separated by commata.&quot;

Additional recommendations and examples; Examples for types of terms that should be used preferably are:

- For &quot;treatment received&quot;: e.g. &quot;polished,&quot; &quot;cleaned,&quot; &quot;chromium plated,&quot; &quot;sterilized,&quot; etc.
- For &quot;standard fulfilled&quot;: technical standards such as for material grades/purity, fulfilled emission limits, etc.
- For &quot;product quality&quot;: other qualitative information such as e.g. &quot;glossy,&quot; &quot;UV-resistant,&quot; &quot;flame-retardant,&quot; &quot;antibacterial finishing,&quot; etc.
- For &quot;use information&quot;: e.g. &quot;indoor use,&quot; &quot;bottle grade,&quot; &quot;for wafer production,&quot; etc.
- For &quot;production route name&quot;: process or production route used for producing this product, such as &quot;suspension polymerization,&quot; &quot;spray dried,&quot; &quot;Fischer-Tropsch,&quot; etc.
- For &quot;educt name&quot;: main in-going products (&quot;educts&quot;) in case different routes exist may be needed, such as &quot;from ore roasting&quot; for sulfuric acid, &quot;pine wood&quot; for timber, etc. (note that in practice often the educt is part of the commonly used base name, e.g. &quot;Pine wood table&quot;).
- For &quot;primary / secondary&quot;: &quot;primary,&quot; &quot;secondary;&quot; for mixes with a fixed share of primary/secondary it should be enough to

## Rule 15: &quot;Mix type and location type&quot; name field

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Definition: &quot;Specifying information on the (product or waste) flow whether being a production mixture or consumption mix, location type of availability (such as e.g. &quot;to consumer&quot; or &quot;at plant&quot;), separated by commata.&quot;

## Rule 16: &quot;Quantitative flow properties&quot; name field

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Definition: &quot;Further, quantitative specifying information on the (product or waste) flow, in technical term(s): qualifying constituent(s)-content and / or energy content per unit, as appropriate. Separated by commata. (Note: non-qualifying flow properties, CAS No, Synonyms, Chemical formulas etc. are documented exclusively in the respective fields.)&quot;

For &quot;qualifying constituent(s)-content and / or energy content per unit&quot;: quantitative element-, substance-, or energy content, expressed in units per unit of a relevant other flow property. Examples: &quot;24% Fe,&quot; &quot;9.6 MJ/kg net calorific value,&quot; &quot;90.5% methane by volume.&quot; Note that often the units are not required explicitly; e.g. &quot;24% Fe&quot; refers per default to &quot;mass/mass.&quot; If another relation is meant, this one has to be given explicitly, of course, e.g. &quot;24% Fe molar&quot; for chemical interim products or e.g. &quot;13.5% ethanol by volume&quot; for wine. Any ambiguity should be avoided, of course.

## Rule 17: Naming pattern of flows and processes.

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

&lt;&quot;Base name;&quot; &quot;Treatment, standards, routes;&quot; &quot;Mix type and location type;&quot; &quot;Quantitative flow properties&quot;&gt;.

## Rule 18: Naming of elementary flows

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Examples shown in brackets, in certain cases compared to the former SETAC recommendation:

- Substances and materials should be given a lower case first letter. Brand names should be given a upper case first letter (E.g. &quot;benzene,&quot; &quot;1,2,3-trichloro-benzene,&quot; &quot;Alachlor&quot;).
- Isotopes of elements (e.g. used for radioactive substances) are given the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name plus the isotope number added at the end with a hyphen (e.g. &quot;radon-220&quot;).
- Particles are to be inventoried via the widely used and understood abbreviation &quot;PM,&quot; with further specification of the particle size class (e.g. &quot;PM &lt;2.5μm&quot; or &quot;PM unspecified.&quot;)
- Salts of O-containing acids are to be named according to the commonly used trivial names as also supported by IUPAC (e.g. &quot;calcium carbonate&quot; better than the name derived from applying the SETAC WG rule, which results in &quot;carbonic acid, calcium salt&quot;).
- Other simple chemicals are to be named according to the commonly used trivial names, if widely used (e.g. &quot;methane,&quot; &quot;sulfuric acid,&quot; &quot;acetone,&quot; etc.).
- Pesticides should be named by their commonly used trivial or even brand names when commonly used as trivial names across industry (e.g. &quot;Alachlor&quot; better than &quot;2-chloro-n-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-n-(methoxymethyl)-acetamide&quot;).
- Artificial splitting of fixed technical terms with change of order of the name fragments is to be avoided (e.g. &quot;hard coal&quot; better than &quot;coal, hard;&quot; the complete flow name should comprise quantitative flow properties information, e.g. &quot;hard coal; 32.7 MJ/kg net calorific value,&quot; of course).
- The attributes of flows &quot;to&quot; for emissions and &quot;in&quot; for resources as foreseen in the SETAC Working Group document are redundant, as this information is already given by the class the flow belongs to (e.g. &quot;Emissions to air&quot;), as this is part of the elementary flow identifying information. For the sake of shortening the flow names this info is not be doubled in the flow name.
- The &quot;…, ion&quot; variants of metal emissions are to be joined with the elemental flow, with the exception of chromium (e.g. the flow &quot;iron&quot; to water should represent all variants, i.e. Fe III, Fe II, organically bound or ionic or complexed iron and metallic Fe to water; note that NO &quot;ion&quot; information is inn the name.). The only exception are the commonly used flows &quot;chromium III&quot; and &quot;chromium VI&quot; ions, while a joint flow &quot;chromium, unspecified&quot; is required, too, that one joining also metallic chromium. (To be revised in view of further developed LCIA methods.)
- Substituted organics are to be named applying the former IUPAC recommendation, that was in place until the late 1990s and is still widely preferred in industry practice (e.g. &quot;1,2,3-trichloro-benzene&quot; better than the new IUPAC pattern that was recommended by the SETAC WG (**_Beaufort-Langeveld et al. 2001_**) &quot;benzene, 1,2,3-trichloro-&quot;).
- Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are to be named using their trivial name. The full chemical name is to be given in the &quot;Synonyms&quot; field only (e.g. &quot;HFC-227&quot; as flow name with the chemical name &quot;1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-propane&quot; only in the &quot;Synonyms&quot; field).
- Carbon dioxide and methane are to be separately inventoried whether from biogenic or fossil sources, both as emission and resource (the latter e.g. from uptake into biomass); the source is added at the end of the base name separated by a comma. (E.g. &quot;carbon dioxide, fossil,&quot; &quot;methane, biogenic&quot;).
- A clearer specification is required for certain flows, e.g. &quot;Wood&quot; from primary forests, as it is unclear whether it refers to the wood only or the whole tree; extracted is however often the tree as a whole (e.g. better &quot;Mahagony wood (Tectona grandis), without bark; standing; primary forest&quot; instead of &quot;wood, Mahagony, standing.&quot; In case the bark would be extracted as well as often done in primary forests, an additional flow of &quot;other wood biomass&quot; would be inventoried).
- Last but not least: Naming is always to be unambiguous; e.g. better &quot;ferrous chloride&quot; or &quot;iron II chloride&quot; instead of the formerly SETAC recommended &quot;iron chloride,&quot; while in this case it is recommended to inventory this emission as the two elementary flows &quot;iron&quot; and &quot;chloride&quot; anyway.

## Rule 19: Naming of product and waste flows

_(Recommended for both technical and non-technical target audience)_

Product and waste flows are to be named using technical names, being as precise as possible, with the different types of information being documented into the four names fields as defined in Rules 12-17. Other information such as represented country/region or year should not be part of the flow name but be documented in separate documentation fields.

## Rule 20: Naming of processes

_(Recommended for both technical and non-technical target audience)_

- The name of process data sets with exactly one &quot;reference flow&quot; should be identical to the name of that reference flow.
- Geographical and data set age information is documented not as part of the flow or process name, but in a separate documentation field.
- The name of multi-functional process data sets with more than one &quot;reference flow&quot; should combine the name of the technology/plant represented and include information on all reference flows.
- The name of process data sets with quantitative references other than &quot;reference flow&quot; (e.g. &quot;functional unit,&quot; &quot;production period,&quot; &quot;other flow,&quot; etc.) should be named according to their quantitative reference. If required for clarity, this name should be combined with the technology or plant name.

## Rule 21: Classification for flow properties

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

- &quot;Technical flow properties&quot; (e.g. &quot;Net calorific value,&quot; &quot;Mass&quot; etc.)
- &quot;Chemical composition of flows&quot; (e.g. &quot;Iron content,&quot; &quot;Methane content&quot; etc.)
- &quot;Economic flow properties&quot; (e.g. &quot;Market value US 1997, bulk prices,&quot; &quot;Market value EU-27 2008, private consumer prices,&quot; etc.)
- &quot;Other flow properties&quot;

## Rule 22: Classification of unit groups

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

- &quot;Technical unit groups&quot; (e.g. &quot;Units of energy,&quot; &quot;Units of mass,&quot; etc.)
- &quot;Economic unit groups&quot; (e.g. &quot;Units of currency 1997,&quot; &quot;Units of currency 1998,&quot; etc.)
- &quot;Other unit groups&quot;

Note that no &quot;Chemical composition unit groups&quot; class is required, as the related flow properties / LCIA factors will always use technical Unit groups and units (e.g. mass, volume, etc.). E.g. it will be &quot;kg&quot; Iron content (per given reference unit of an enriched ore flow, i.e. kg Fe per kg iron ore).

## Rule 23: Reference flow properties and reference units for types of flows, first criterion

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

All flows that possess a mass, are measured in the flow property &quot;Mass,&quot; as long as none of the below rules would require to use a different flow property. The unit group for mass is &quot;Units of mass&quot; with the reference unit &quot;kg.&quot;

## Rule 24: Reference flow properties and reference units for types of flows, second criterion

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Elementary flows, for which the energy content is the most relevant unit, are measured in the flow property &quot;Net calorific value.&quot; The unit group for the net calorific value is &quot;Units of energy&quot; with the reference unit &quot;MJ.&quot;

Product and waste flows such as fuels, in contrast, can be measured as-is general usage, e.g. in mass (e.g. diesel, hard coal, etc.), normal volume (e.g. natural gas), &quot;Net calorific value&quot; with the unit &quot;MJ,&quot; or other. Note that for Uranium ore, for which a net calorific value per se cannot be given, the usable fission energy content is expressed nevertheless as &quot;Net calorific value&quot; to ease aggregation with other fossil energy resources to primary energy consumption figures.

## Rule 25: Reference flow properties and reference units for types of flows, further criteria

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

Further criteria for reference flow properties and reference units are:

- Product and waste flows that are typically dealt with in standard volume and for which none of the other units named in Rule 21-27 in use in practice, are measured in the flow property &quot;Standard volume&quot; (e.g. for the product flows &quot;Compressed air; 10 bar,&quot; &quot;Oxygen; from refill gas cylinder of 40 l; 150 bar,&quot; etc.). Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of volume&quot; with the reference unit &quot;m3.&quot;
- Flows that are typically dealt with in number of items are measured in the flow property &quot;Number&quot; (e.g. product flows &quot;Spare tire passenger car; generic average,&quot; &quot;Milk cow; Holstein, alive, start of lactation&quot; etc.).
- Product and waste flows that are typically dealt with in duration are measured in the flow property &quot;Time&quot; (e.g. product flow / functional unit &quot;Storage in warehouse; unheated&quot;). Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of time&quot; with the reference unit &quot;d,&quot; i.e. days.
- Product and waste flows that are typically dealt with in weight multiplied with distance are measured in the flow property &quot;Mass\*length&quot; (e.g. product flow / functional unit &quot;Road transport; bulk goods, generic mix; long distance&quot;). Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of mass\*length&quot; with the reference unit &quot;t\*km.&quot;
- Product and waste flows that are typically dealt with in volume multiplied with distance are measured in the flow property &quot;Volume\*length&quot; (e.g. product flow / functional unit &quot;Road transport; voluminous goods, generic mix; long distance&quot;). Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of volume\*length&quot; with the reference unit &quot;m3\*km.&quot;
- Person transport product flows / functional units are given in the flow property &quot;Person\*distance.&quot; Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of items\*length&quot; with the reference unit &quot;Items\*km.&quot;
- Flows that are typically dealt with in surface area are measured in the flow property &quot;Area&quot; (e.g. elementary flow &quot;Land conversion; XY specification,&quot; product flow / functional unit &quot;Surface cleaning; heavily soiled, plastic; 1 m2&quot;). The unit group is &quot;Units of area&quot; with the reference unit &quot;m2.&quot;
- Flows that are typically dealt with in surface area multiplied with time are measured in the flow property &quot;Area\*time&quot; (e.g. elementary flow &quot;Land occupation; XY specification,&quot; product flow / functional unit &quot;Façade weather protection; exposed, white; 70% reflection&quot;).The unit group is &quot;Units of area\*time&quot; with the reference unit &quot;m2\*a.&quot; (1 year approximated as 365 days).
- Product and waste flows that are typically dealt with in volume multiplied with time are measured in the flow property &quot;Volume\*time&quot; (e.g. product flow / functional unit &quot;Landfill occupation&quot;). Not applicable to elementary flows. The unit group is &quot;Units of volume\*time&quot; with the reference unit &quot;m3\*a.&quot; (1 year approximated as 365 days).
- For products where the content of specific elements or of well-defined chemical compounds is of interest, the respective information should be given as secondary flow property for conversion, display, or modeling purposes. This is done using flow properties of the type &quot;Substance/element X content,&quot; e.g. &quot;Cadmium content,&quot; &quot;Ammonia content,&quot; &quot;Water content,&quot; &quot;Methane content&quot; etc. (Nomenclature for the element or substance name should be identical to the one for these elements or substances as given elsewhere in these rules). Depending on the specific interest, the information can be given in mass or volume units: E.g. &quot;Iron content&quot; in the product flow &quot;Iron ore, enriched; floating …&quot; as mass information or &quot;Methane content&quot; in the product flow &quot;Natural gas; …&quot; volumetric. The required &quot;Unit group data set&quot; is then the same as already defined &quot;Units of mass&quot; and &quot;Units of volume,&quot; i.e. there is no necessity to define new Unit group data sets.
- For product and waste flows where the economic value should be given (typically as secondary flow property for allocation purposes or cost calculation in Life Cycle Costing) this is done using the flow property &quot;Market value,&quot; which is further specified as required, typically referring to the country or region, time period, and wholesale/retail etc. situation, by adding the respective information: E.g. &quot;Market value US 1997, bulk prices,&quot; &quot;Market value EU 2000, private consumer prices.&quot; (Can be used for e.g. product / waste / elementary flows &quot;Gold,&quot; &quot;Waste tires,&quot; &quot;Carbon dioxide,&quot; etc.). The unit group name is formed by the combination of the string &quot;Units of currency&quot; and an addition that characterizes the time period to which it refers, e.g. &quot;1997,&quot; &quot;1990-1999,&quot; &quot;May 1995&quot; etc., e.g. &quot;Units of currency 1997&quot; with the reference unit &quot;EUR,&quot; i.e. Euro.

(Note: The reference to a time period is required to allow giving correct average conversion numbers for other currencies for that time period).The unit group is &quot;Units of items&quot; with the reference unit &quot;Item(s)&quot;.

## Rule 26: Creation and naming of flow properties, unit groups and units

_(Mandatory for technical target audience, recommended for non-technical target audience)_

The creation/use of new flow properties, unit groups and units should be avoided, if possible, and any of the existing ones as provided in the upcoming more complete list of the ILCD system should be used.

If the creation of new flow properties and unit groups is unavoidable (as to be expected e.g. for economic flow properties), they should be named following the same pattern as the ones above, i.e. flow properties carry the name of the physical or other property, units carry the unit short as name (with the option to provide a long name and further info in the comment field foreseen in the data format). Unit groups are named by a combination of the string &quot;Units of&quot; and the name of the flow property they refer to. Please note, that in certain cases it is useful to have common unit groups for more than one flow property were all are measured in the same units. In such cases the naming can be referred to a more general flow property (e.g. &quot;Energy&quot;  &quot;Units of energy&quot;) and not only to one specific one (e.g. NOT &quot;Units of net calorific value&quot; or &quot;Units of exergy&quot; etc.).

## Rule 27: Classification of contact data sets

_(Recommended for technical and non-technical target audience)_

- &quot;Group of organizations, project&quot;
- &quot;Organizations&quot;
- &quot;Private companies&quot;
- &quot;Governmental organizations&quot;
- &quot;Non-governmental organizations&quot;
- &quot;Other organizations&quot;
- &quot;Working groups within organizations&quot;
- &quot;Persons&quot;
- &quot;Other&quot;

## Rule 28: Classification of source data sets

_(Recommended for technical and non-technical target audience)_

- &quot;Images&quot;
- &quot;Data set formats&quot;
- &quot;Databases&quot;
- &quot;Compliance systems&quot;
- &quot;Statistical classifications&quot;
- &quot;Publications and communications&quot;
- &quot;Other source types&quot;
