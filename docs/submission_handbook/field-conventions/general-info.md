|(M) Name|Process name based on the [USLCI naming convention]((../04-resources/04-App-E.md); the name should reflect the product or service it represents; the product reference output is given the same name as the process name; the naming conventions are as follows:<br>**Base name; treatment, routes, standards; production type, location type; quantitative flow properties**<br>The base name is a general descriptive name of the process using technical language. The technical name should be given as it is used in the respective industry or toward their customers. The standards include qualitative information about the process in technical terms (see Rules 12-17 [Appendix D: ILCD Nomenclature Rules](../04-resources/04-App-D.md) or the full [ILCD Handbook](http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/MANPROJ-PR-ILCD-Handbook-Nomenclature-and-other-conventions-first-edition-ISBN-fin-v1.0-E.pdf) for a list of potential descriptive terms). The quantitative process properties further specify information on process in technical quantitative term(s).<br>Base name and treatment/routes/standards are mandatory; production/location type is mandatory if relevant to the process (if not, it can be ignored); the location type of availability (LCAC) is designated only if the process is not a mix; if the process is a production or consumption mix, the mix type is indicated; finally, any essential quantitative properties of the product or process should be included<br>For consistent nomenclature, use the following guidelines:<br><ul><li>separate components with a semi-colon</li><li>separate elements within a component with a comma</li><li>abbreviations should be avoided</li><li>limit names to 220 characters</li><ul>|**Example with 3 components**<br>_Clinker; average mineral mix, at kiln, 1415 kg/m3_<br><br>**Example with 3 components**<br>_Transport; long-haul truck, diesel powered; trip length > 200 mi_<br><br>**Example with 2 components**<br>_Scanner manufacture; Kodak Alaris i940 desktop manufacturing process_|
