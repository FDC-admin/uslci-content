Thank you for your interest in providing access to your life cycle inventory (LCI) data through the US LCI Database (USLCI), part of the life cycle assessment (LCA) Data Commons. Datasets submitted to the USLCI Database must adhere to specific data documentation, formatting, and nomenclature requirements to ensure lossless loading of data and accurate representation in the repository.

The USLCI repository application provides users access to your data in all major LCA data formats and permits connectivity between your data and other LCA data resources.

The guidance and requirements in this document are intended do the following:

1. Help the Data Provider:
    *  Provide sufficient metadata to describe unit processes and/or product systems accurately
    *  Prepare elementary flows for use in openLCA

2. Help users:
    *  Identify flow provenance
    *  Connect flows to and from the unit process and their providing/receiving LCA elements. These LCA elements may be other unit processes or impact methods.

The LCA Commons data curation process is collaborative and iterative. Upon submission, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will conduct an internal review of your dataset to verify compliance with these LCA Commons Submission Guidelines and elementary flow connectivity with one or more impact methods. Upon culmination of the internal review, NREL will collaborate with you to reconcile issues identified in the internal dataset documentation review (i.e., metadata review). It is important to note this process does not include a technical review of the inventory data.

Before submitting data, please review these guidelines, the Data Provider’s Content License Agreement (“Agreement”), and the Placing Your Data in the Public Domain section of this document. If you have any questions, concerns, or recommendations, please at: lci@nrel.gov.
