The handbook is divided into four major sections.  
1. [Should I publish my data in the USLCI?](./01-should-i-publish-in-the-uslci.md)
1. [How do I publish my data in the USLCI?](./02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md)

[Section 1](./01-should-i-publish-in-the-uslci.md) helps potential data Providers decide if publishing their data in the USLCI Database/Federal Data Commons is a good fit for their publication goals. This section includes information on the benefits of publishing in the USLCI Database and dataset standards and formatting requirements.  [Section 2](./02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) contains a detailed guidance for publishing data in the USLCI. This section includes information on the data curation process, information on data forms (e.g., nomenclature, units, metadata, peer review), and submission instructions.  [Section 3](./03-frequently-asked-questions.md) provides answers to frequently asked questions.  [Section 4](./04-resources/04-resources.md) contains links to templates, tools, licensing information, an openLCA example, and other files which support the data submission process.
