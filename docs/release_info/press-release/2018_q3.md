# Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server :grey_exclamation:
The Fall 2018 USLCI Database update contains several new and updated processes and you can view the details in the [USLCI Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/change-log.md). The Fall 2018 USLCI updated database is now accessible via a new platform, the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) within the [National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI) group page. This new platform has been developed to provide a common access point for LCA data under the [Federal LCA Commons](https://www.lcacommons.gov/catalog) coordinated activities. 

### More Info on the Federal LCA Commons

NREL is collaborating with the [US Department of Agriculture (USDA)](https://www.usda.gov/) the [Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/), the [National Energy Technology Library (NETL)](https://www.netl.doe.gov/), the [Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)](http://www.anl.gov/), the [US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)](https://www.usace.army.mil/), the [Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/), the [US Forest Service (USFS)](https://www.fs.fed.us/), the [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)](https://www.faa.gov/), and the [National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/) to develop a US Federal LCA Data Commons. This ongoing effort endeavors to provide improved and coordinated access to Federal LCA data. 

The Federal LCA Commons primary mission is to pool the available LCA expertise among Federal agencies that collect, compile, and provide public access to data and information that adds value to life cycle assessors in an effective manner.

Much work has gone into the current [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) platform to provide a common access point for the collection of Federal LCA Commons repositories. The interface will evolve as Federal LCA Commons members continue to coordinate the integration of data and expertise. 

The primary benefit of this new Collaboration Server is that users may access multiple repositories from various Federal agencies and LCA data providers. Using this new platform, LCI data may be imported directly into your local [openLCA](http://www.openlca.org/) software. **NOTE:** An **_update on using the platform in openLCA is coming soon!_** -- watch our [Press Releases](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/press-release.md) page.

## Navigating the USLCI in the Collaboration Server Beta Version :nut_and_bolt:

This collective access point also means that, while the breadth of LCA data is much greater, the method for accessing USLCI data has changed significantly. For the time being, we have found that with the current interface, those accustomed to the older platform will find the following approach helpful.

Access USLCI data on the Collaboration Server by selecting it under the **"National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory"** Group Repository on the right side of the [Federal LCA Commons landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search).

<br>
<br>

You may filter the USLCI data in many ways on this new platform. You may then use the **"Search"** feature once you have filtered the USLCI data and only the USLCI results will be presented. However, if you are accustomed to the old platform, the most expedient way to browse for and/or download specific USLCI data on the new platform is to filter by **"Categories"** via the **"Processes"** list.

<br>

Of course, the **"Search"** feature is also available on the [Federal LCA Commons landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) and you will likely find it useful to also explore the additional repository data that are now available.

## New Data Submissions Guidelines for USLCI :green_book:

For the convenience of USLCI data providers, NREL has made details about the data submission process available in the [USLCI Data Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/00-sub-handbook-landing.md).

This Data Submission Handbook is part of the [USLCI Content GitHub Repository](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/wiki) and is intended to support the new USLCI Digital Data Submission process. **Note this is a living document and is being updated as the Federal LCA Commons data submission process evolves.**


For a quick overview, this section of the USLCI Submission Guidelines summarizes the [USLCI Digital Curation Process](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md#overview-digital-curation).


The [USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) LCA Commons](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/lca-commons) is another repository in the Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server and will accept unit processes related to agricultural production. The NAL data are accessible via the [Federal LCA Commons landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) on the Collaboration Server. 

Whether you decide to publish your data in the USDA NAL repository, the USLCI repository or both, the digital curation process is similar. Either location would give users access to the data via the Federal LCA Commons. For either, the publication process is taking anywhere from weeks to months depending on the size and number of datasets as well as your level of involvement during iterative communications. 

**NOTE:** The USDA NAL is updated as needed and the US LCI is being updated on a quarterly basis (i.e., March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). 

For details on submitting to the NAL, please see the [USDA NAL LCA Commons Submission Guidelines](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/usda-lca-commons-data-submission-guidelines/resource/81709128-15a6-4c1c-b634-21d93bb8eefa).

## Questions & Feedback on the Beta Version :question:

We welcome feedback and questions regarding the USLIC data on the new [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search); please contact the USLCI webmaster at lci@nrel.gov with any concerns, questions, and/or to coordinate submitting data to the USLCI Database.
