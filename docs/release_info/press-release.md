This page provides quarterly updates and news regarding the [USLCI Database](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory) publishing updates. These updates are compiled by the USLCI Data Curator on the behalf of the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)](https://www.nrel.gov/). For more information and publications regarding the creation and evolution of the USLCI, please see NREL's [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database](https://www.nrel.gov/lci/) project pages.

## 2018 - Winter Quarter Impending
The USLCI quarterly update will occur on December 21, 2018 and then not again until March 31, 2019. Please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the USLCI Data Curator (rebe.feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for either of these release dates. Of course, any curation project for the December release would have to be a relatively small effort given the time constraints. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
