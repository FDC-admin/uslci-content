## 2019 Summer Quarter (June 30)
The USLCI quarterly update occurred on June 30, 2019. The most recent udate of the [USLCI Database](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory) is now available on the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search), which contains multiple group repositories. For this update, there was a display correction for the hydrogen synthesis dataset, some corrections to the allocation settings for some wood manufacturing processes, and several deletions of old providers.

Additionally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the USLCI Data Curator (rebe.feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the September 30, Fall 2019 release date. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

NREL is publishing a coordination report to provide information about the US Federal Life Cycle Assessment Commons (FLCAC). The FLCAC is not only a public data source but also a repository for data developed under Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) programs. The FLCAC Commons Working Group is coordinating and focusing efforts to improve the standardization of data documentation, formatting, and nomenclature to ensure lossless data loading and accurate data representation in the repository server. The report introduces LCA within EERE programs, describes the current status of the FLCAC, and iterates opportunities for the FLCAC to support EERE goals and objectives. See the [full Coordination Report here](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/coordination_report/toc.md).
